# Python_Iris_and_Medical_Cost_Machine_Learning
This is the first practice project I have made to learn machine learning. It uses the following datasets from Kaggle:
**Iris Species** (_https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/iris_)
**Medical Cost Personal Datasets** (_https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance_)

As this is my first machine learning project, it is quite messy.
